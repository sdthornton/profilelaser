      <section class="three_column">
        <div id="production" class="process_icon"></div>

        <h2>Efficient Production</h2>
        <h3>We'll make sure your project is done quickly and is done well.</h3>

      <h1>Why Laser Cutting?<br><span class="sub_head">What's So Great About It?</span></h1>
      <p>Laser cutting might be just what your project needs! Laser cutting offers an accurate and affordable way to produce almost any shape in sheet metal or plate.</p>

      <section class="three_column">
        <div id="afford" class="process_icon"></div>

        <h2>Affordability</h2>
        <p>Because of high feed rates, efficient layout of parts on the sheet, no special tooling requirements, and very little material wasted, pieces can be cut at a low cost.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="three_column">
        <div id="accuracy" class="process_icon"></div>

        <h2>Accuracy</h2>
        <p>Lasers are remarkably accurate. Your parts can be cut within a thousandth of an inch and the first part will be exactly like the last, whether cutting two pieces or thousands.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="three_column">
        <div id="flexibility" class="process_icon"></div>

        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>A laser is equally well-suited for prototyping or production, cutting or etching. A laser can be compared to an artist’s brush&mdash;in capable hands it’s limited only by the imagination.</p>
